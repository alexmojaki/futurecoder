Make sure you fully grasp what's going on. `print(letter)` and `print('---')` each run 3 times, because their indentation puts them in the *outer loop*. `print(f'{letter} {number}')` is called 3 Ã— 4 = 12 times, because it's in the *inner loop* `for number in range(4):` which has 4 iterations but is itself in the outer loop so it runs 3 times.

Let's put this to use! Suppose you're a teacher and you need to print out all the multiplication tables from 1 to 12 for your students. You don't want to write them manually, but you can write a program to do it for you! Your program output should look like this including the lines of dashes:

You need to use a for loop inside a for loop.
You need the numbers from 1 to 12.
Whenever you need a sequence of consecutive numbers, use `range`.
You want something like `for x in range(n):`.
This will start with `x = 0`, but there's an easy workaround for that.
You can just add 1 to `x`.
Use `*` to multiply numbers.
Use an f-string with several variables.
Remember to print a line with the correct number of dashes after each section.
Make sure each line is in the correct loop and has the right amount of indentation.

While the other tools show how code runs line by line and the values of variables, Bird's Eye shows you the value of every expression in a program. This lets you see how a complex expression is broken down into smaller sub-expressions
and what the value of each one is.

Hover your mouse over the various boxed expressions in the last line of the program.
As each box is highlighted, its value is shown at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the box will stick it on a panel so you can see several expression values at once and move your mouse around freely.

In this case Bird's Eye shows that the expression:

    a * b + c * d

is broken into

    (a * b) + (c * d)

rather than

    ((a * b) + c) * d

In other words, Python follows the usual order of operations in maths, rather than just evaluating from left to right.

Note that there are some expressions that Bird's Eye doesn't put in a box. In this case `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `print` are all expressions as well, but their values are obvious and boxing them would just be clutter.
