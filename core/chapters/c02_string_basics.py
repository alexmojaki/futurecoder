Python lets you do much more than calculate. In fact, we're not going to touch numbers or maths for a while. Instead, we're going to look at *strings*. Strings are essentially snippets of text. For example, enter the following into the shell, quotes (`'`) included:

__program_indented__
        """

        program = "'hello'"

    final_text = """
The shell simply gives the same thing back because there's nothing to further to calculate. `'hello'` is simply equal to `'hello'`.

A string is a sequence of characters. A character is a single symbol such as a letter, number, punctuation, space, etc. In this case the string contains the 4 characters `hello`. The quotes are not part of the string - they are there to tell both humans and computers that this is a string consisting of whatever characters are between the quotes.

Strings can be added together using `+`, although this means something very different from adding numbers. For example, try:

__program_indented__
        """

        """
You can see that `+` combines or joins two strings together end to end. Technically, this is called concatenation.

Here's an exercise: change the previous code slightly so that the result is the string `'hello world'`, i.e. with a space between the words.

By the way, if you get stuck, you can click the lightbulb icon in the bottom right for a hint.
