We've seen several types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `list`.
Only one of these types can contain multiple values: `list`.
Now we're going to learn about another container type: `dict`, short for ***dictionary***.

Think of the familiar kind of dictionary where you look up a word to find its definition or a translation in another language.
Dictionaries in Python are similar, but more general. You look up a *key* (e.g. a word) to get the associated *value* (e.g. a definition or translation).

For example, here's a little dictionary translating English words to French:

    __program_indented__

Run the line above in the shell.

`french` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs:

- `'apple': 'pomme'` where `'apple'` is the key and `'pomme'` is the value.
- `'box': 'boite'` where `'box'` is the key and `'boite'` is the value.

Like lists, a comma (`,`) is used to separate items (key-value pairs) from each other. A colon (`:`) separates the keys from the values.
Note that curly brackets (`{}`) are used to create the dictionary instead of the square brackets (`[]`) used when writing lists.

Remember that with lists, you get values based on their *index*, i.e. their position in the list.
So if `words = ['apple', 'box']`, then `words[0]` is `'apple'` and `words[1]` is `'box'`.
Try this in the shell:

The dictionary `french` only has 2 keys: `'apple'` and `'box'`. `'pomme'` is a value, not a key.
We'll soon learn why you can't just look up values directly, and what you can do about it.

Note that both `french[0]` and `french['pomme']` raised the same type of error: a `KeyError`.
This error means that the provided key (`0` or `'pomme'` in this case) wasn't found in the dictionary.
It's not that `french[0]` isn't *allowed*, it's just that it means the same thing as always:
find the value associated with the key `0`. In this case it finds that no such key exists.

Let's see dictionaries in a real life problem. Imagine you're building an online shopping website.
You keep the prices of all your items in a dictionary:

    prices = {'apple': 2, 'box': 5, 'cat': 100, 'dog': 100}

Here you can see one reason why looking up values in a dictionary could be a problem.
What would `prices[100]` be? `'dog'`? `'cat'`? `['dog', 'cat']`?
The same value can be repeated any number of times in a dictionary.
On the other hand, keys have to be unique. Imagine if your prices started like this:

    prices = {'apple': 2, 'apple': 3}

How much does an apple cost? We know it's `prices['apple']`, but is that `2` or `3`?
Clearly there should only be one price, so duplicate keys aren't allowed.

Anyway, this is a normal shop where things have one price.
This normal shop has normal customers with normal shopping lists like `['apple', 'box', 'cat']`.
And even though your customers have calculators in their pockets, they still expect you to add up all the prices
yourself and tell them how much this will all cost, because that's what normal shops do.

The same function works in both directions, we just need to pass it different dictionaries.

The two dictionaries are almost the same, we just swap around the key and value in each pair.
So to encrypt, we replace `e` with `p`, and to decrypt we change `p` back to `e`.

Note that `'e'` is both a key and a value in `letters`.

Looking up `letters['e']` means that we're asking about `'e'` as a *key*, so it gives `'p'`.
Remember, we can't use `letters` to ask which key is associated with `'e'` as a *value*.
But in this case we can use the other dictionary for that: `reverse['e']` gives `'l'`,
and `letters['l']` gives `'e'` again.

Soon you'll write a function to create a dictionary like `reverse` automatically,
i.e. `reverse = swap_keys_values(letters)`."""
