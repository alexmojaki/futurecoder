Let's see if we can do better. We could replace both `print` statements with:

    print("I have a friend called " + name + "!")

We could also combine the two `if` statements into one using **`or`**. `or` is a *boolean operator*,
meaning it's an operator (like `+` or `-`) which combines two booleans (`True` or `False`).

The expression `A or B` is `True` if either `A` or `B` is `True`, i.e. if `A` is `True` or `B` is `True`, or both.
It's only `False` if neither `A` nor `B` is `True`, i.e. both are `False`.

What then happens is:

- `name == "Alice"` evaluates to `False`,
- `name == "Alice" or "Bob"` evaluates to `"Bob"`, and
-  `if "Bob"` triggers the `print` statement

Perhaps you feel like this:

[![I now have additional questions](https://i.imgur.com/jN57tGt.png)](https://imgur.com/a/icKzI)

The only thing you really need to know is this: Until you know what you're doing, always
make sure you put booleans on both sides of `or`, because it's a boolean operator.
`name == "Alice" or "Bob"` breaks that rule.

If you're curious, the answers are below, but you can skip them if you want.

----

> Why does `(name == "Alice") or ("Bob")` equal `"Bob"`? Why does it equal anything? `"Bob"` isn't even a boolean!

The definition "`A or B` is `True` if either `A` or `B` is `True`" was a simplification. It's the easiest
way to think about `or` most of the time, especially for writing `if` statements.
The real definition is that if `A` is true then `A or B` is just `A` (in fact `B` is not even evaluated),
otherwise it's `B`.
You can see for yourself that if `A` and `B` are booleans then the two definitions are equivalent.
In this example `A` is `name == "Alice"` which is `False`, so `A or B` is `B` which is `"Bob"`.

> Why does `if "Bob"` run the body? Again, `"Bob"` isn't a boolean!

Python actually lets you treat anything like a boolean. Most things are equivalent to `True` in this context,
including all strings (such as `"Bob"`) except the empty string which is 'falsy'.

> Is there a better way to write the condition without repeating `name ==` each time?

Yes! In [Functions and Methods for Lists](/course/?page=FunctionsAndMethodsForLists) we mentioned the `in`
operator, which you can use with a list like this:

    if name in ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]:

But you can't always get rid of `or` like that.
