You've done many short exercises solving one little problem. Now we're going to tackle a larger, more complex
project which will really test your knowledge and require combining many smaller parts together.
It's going to be so fun!

You will develop a text-based interactive tic-tac-toe game to be played by 2 human players.
Here is a small preview of what the finished game will look like in play:

     123
    1
    2
    3

    X to play
    Enter row: 2
    Enter column: 2
     123
    1
    2 X
    3

    O to play
    Enter row: 1
    Enter column: 3
     123
    1  O
    2 X
    3

We will break up the project into several small functions, which will be exercises.

You will use many of the concepts you have learned so far: strings,
nested lists, nested loops, `range`, calling functions within functions, comparisons, and booleans.

Along the way you will also learn some new concepts: `input`, the newline character, types in Python, and `while` loops.

Here is a rough outline of the project:

- three functions `row_winner`, `column_winner`,  `diagonal_winner`  that check the whole board for winning rows, columns, and diagonals
- a function `winner` that checks the whole board for a winner, combining the above functions
- a function `format_board` that displays the current state of the game
- a function `get_coordinate` that takes user input to play a move,
- finally a `main` function that puts it all together and runs the game interactively.
- Later on we will add further improvements.

Let's get started!

As in the last chapter, we will represent the tic-tac-toe board as a nested list of strings.
For a typical game this will be a 3x3 list, i.e. 3 lists each containing 3 strings, with players represented by `'X'` or `'O'`.
Empty squares will be represented by a space, i.e. `' '`. For example:

    board = [
        ['X', 'O', 'X'],
        ['O', ' ', ' '],
        [' ', 'X', 'O']
    ]

However to make things more interesting your code will need to work for square boards of any size
(4x4, 5x5, etc) where players can be represented by any strings, e.g.

    board = [
        ['A', 'B', 'A', 'A'],
        ['B', ' ', ' ', 'A'],
        [' ', 'A', 'B', 'B'],
        [' ', 'A', 'B', ' ']
    ]

Write a function `row_winner` which returns `True` if `board` contains
a winning row, i.e. a horizontal line which has the same character in all its entries (except `' '`):

    __copyable__
    def row_winner(board):
        ...

    assert_equal(
        row_winner(
            [
                ['A', 'A', 'B', 'A'],
                [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
                ['A', ' ', ' ', 'A'],
                ['B', ' ', 'B', 'A']
            ]
        ),
        False
    )
    assert_equal(
        row_winner(
            [
                ['X', ' ', 'X'],
                ['O', 'X', 'X'],
                ['O', 'O', 'O']
            ]
        ),
        True
    )

In the second example, `O` wins in the bottom row.
        """

        hints = """
You need to check every row in the board, so you'll need a loop for that.
How can you check if all entries in a row are equal to each other?
That's a self contained problem on its own. You can start by forgetting about the whole board and just checking a single row.
You could even write a function which just does this, although you don't have to. 
Since the row could have any size, you'll have to loop all the way through it.
For each row, define a boolean. Then loop through that row, updating the boolean accordingly.
You can use the first entry `row[0]` in a row to compare all the row entries to it.
Think carefully about what the initial value of the boolean should be, and under what conditions you should change its value.
After looping through a row, if you determined that all its entries are equal, then return `True` (ending the outer loop early).
Make sure you don't return `True` for a row filled with spaces.
Make sure you return `False` if there are no winning rows

You can start by imitating `row_winner` above, then change it to make it work with columns.
You can't loop through the columns of `board` as simply as its rows.
What *is* a column of a nested list? The first column consists of the first element of the first row, the first element of the second row, etc.
Looping through all columns means looking at the first element of every row, then the second element of every row, etc.
So you need to loop through numbers representing the positions first, second, etc. 
How do you find the number of columns in `board`?
That covers the outer loop, which goes through each column. Then you need an inner loop to go thread each element in the column.
The different entries of a column are NOT on the same row. So how can you access them?
You can loop through rows of the board and find the element corresponding to that row and the current column.
To access all the entries of, say, the 5th column, you can loop through all the rows, and access the 5th element in each row.
Define a boolean for each column, then update it accordingly inside the inner loop.
The rest of the logic is very similar to `row_winner`.
Watch out for `' '`.
Remember to return `False` at the end if needed.

Write an improved version of `format_board` that displays row and column separators. For example, if

    board = [
        ['X', 'O', 'X'],
        [' ', 'O', 'O'],
        [' ', 'X', ' ']
    ]

    X|O|X
    -+-+-
     |O|O
    -+-+-
     |X|

Once again it should work for a square `board` of *any size*.

There are two types of lines to be displayed: one type has the pieces joined by `|`s in between them, the other type has `-`s joined by `+`s in between them.
Both of these types of lines can be built up by using `join` appropriately.
For example, how can you convert a row `['X', 'O', 'X']` into `'X|O|X'` using `join`?
Similarly, how can you obtain `'-+-+-'` using `join`? To what list should you apply `join`?
Once you figured out how to build up both types of lines, how can you combine them to obtain the final result?
Notice that the lines with the `+-`  signs are always the same.
And there is one line with `+-` separating every consecutive pair of lines with pieces.
You can use `join` on the lines themselves!
The lines with the pieces can be joined together with the `+-` line in between them (with newlines added in appropriate places).
To do that, first you need to keep the lines with the pieces stored in a list as you are building them.
Then apply `join` to that list, with the `+-` line as separator.
To add the newlines to the `+-` line correctly, take a look at the test case we provided.

Using a string instead of an integer in `range` like `range('5')`,
or in list subscripting like `list['3']` will also lead to an error.

Most of these problems can be solved by converting the string to an integer by using `int` as a function:
`int('5')` will return the integer `5`.
Similarly an integer can be converted to a string by using `str` as a function:
`str(5)` will return the string `'5'`.

Using this new knowledge, fix this broken program:

    __copyable__
    number = '3'
    for i in range(number):
        print('Starting... ' + i + 1)
    print('Go!')

The correct program should print:

    Starting... 2
    Starting... 3

Your solution should work for any value of the variable `number`.

You can start by using the ideas from your previous solution to `format_board`. Using `join` is highly recommended!
The first line has to be treated separately from the rest.

We want numbers on the first line like this: 1, 2, 3...
Each number has to be converted to a string before being added to the first row!
For the rows of the board itself, do something similar.
Start with a list consisting only of the first line that you built above.
Add each row's string to the list, then join the list with a newline character.
